<h3>CS 855: Development of High-Assurance Software Systems, Spring 2024</h3><hr class="docutils" />
<div class="section" id="purpose">
<h2>Purpose<a class="headerlink" href="#purpose" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The course will cover techniques for developing high assurance systems &#8211; systems that are safety critical, security critical, or mission critical in nature. In contrast to general purpose systems, high assurance system development tends to place a more stronger emphasis on rigorous requirements and specifications, verification and validation, risk management, and certification. High assurance system development is more likely to be amenable to and benefit from formal verification techniques &#8211; techniques that use various forms of machine-checkable mathematics or logic to demonstrate that a system satisfies its specification. The goal of this course teach techniques for developing critical software that would usually not be covered in other courses in your computer science degree program. In particular, the course will focus on writing requirements for safety critical systems, formal architecture definition, risk management techniques including various forms of hazard analysis, safety systems, and automated verification. We will aim to illustrate an end-to-end development process for critical systems using examples of varying size.</p>
<p>Note: There is not enough time in the course to cover all topics
relevant to safety-critical system development in detail.
Topics chosen by the instructor in a particular semester will depend on the
instructor&#8217;s current research activities.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="topics">
<h2>Topics<a class="headerlink" href="#topics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>

sensing, actuating, etc.</li>
<li>Modeling embedded systems in AADL and SysMLv2</li>
<li>Developing and simulated real-time embedded systems using the HAMR

<li>Property-based testing and formal verification of component and system
implementations against executable and logic contracts</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>Prerequisites<a class="headerlink" href="#prerequisites" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The course does not have any official prequisites, but CS 721
Real-Time Systems would be helpful.</p>
<p>There is quite a bit of programming in the course, so strong
experience with programming and development environments will be helpful.</p>

<div class="section" id="grading">
<h2>Grading<a class="headerlink" href="#grading" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Individual Homework Assignments (35%)</li>
<li>Quizzes (15%)</li>
<li>Team Projects (50%)</li>
</ul>
<p>Final letter grades are assigned based on the following scale:
90% to earn an A, and 80% to earn a B; 70% to earn a C, and 60% to earn a D.</p>
<p>This course includes both individual assignments and team
projects. Individual assignments are expected to be completed
&#8220;individually&#8221; (with no collaboration with other students). For team
projects, each student is expected to make a unique and substantial
contribution to the assigned project. Expectations for the project
will be clarified by constructing a written contract that will
summarize scope of the project, expected artifacts along with format
and completeness of artifacts to be delivered, role and
responsibilities of individual team members. The department does not
assign a teaching assistant for this course. Because it will be
difficult for the instructor to cover all the grading responsibilities
for the course, the assessment mechanisms for the course will involve
students in the course critiquing and evaluating work of other
students (note that this type of activity will be overseen by the
instructor to ensure quality).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="attendance-policy">
<h2>Attendance Policy<a class="headerlink" href="#attendance-policy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In general, there will be NO make-up exams (and homework)!
Special consideration will be given in only exceptional circumstances.
Exceptional circumstances are generally limited to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Emergencies: death in student&#8217;s immediate family, or
near-death experience of the student.</li>
<li>Non-emergencies: certified excused absences for official university activities.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you believe you qualify for exceptional treatment, you must notify the
instructor prior to the date of the exam or exercise to be missed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="statement-regarding-academic-honesty">
<h2>Statement Regarding Academic Honesty<a class="headerlink" href="#statement-regarding-academic-honesty" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Kansas State University has an Honor System based on personal integrity, which
is presumed to be sufficient assurance in academic matters one&#8217;s work is
performed honestly and without unauthorized assistance.
Undergraduate and graduate students, by registration, acknowledge the
jurisdiction of the Honor System.
The policies and procedures of the Honor System apply to all full and part-time
students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate courses on-campus, off-campus,
and via distance learning.
The honor system website can be reach via the following URL:
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.ksu.edu/honor">http://www.ksu.edu/honor</a>.</p>
<p>A component vital to the Honor System is the inclusion of the Honor Pledge which
applies to all assignments, examinations, or other course work undertaken by
students.
The Honor Pledge is implied, whether or not it is stated:
&#8220;On my honor, as a student, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid
on this academic work.&#8221;
A grade of XF can result from a breach of academic honesty.
The F indicates failure in the course; the X indicates the reason is an Honor
Pledge violation.</p>
