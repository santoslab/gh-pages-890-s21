   <h3>CIS 890: Development of High-Assurance Software Systems, Spring 2021</h3>

This class will include several projects, and this page will be
updated throughout the semester to provide background material and
resources for the projects.

PCA Pump 
********************************

In a Department of Homeland Security research project, SAnToS
researchers worked with Adventium Labs to develop an open source
medical device platform and a Patient Controlled Analgesic Pump built
using the platform.  Much of the functionality of the PCA Pump has
already been implemented in the Slang Embedded development framework.

This project will enhance the existing PCA Pump infrastructure by:

* adding real-time annotations in AADL suitable for getting the project to run
  through the AADL schedulability analysis tools,
* developing a deployment of the pump function on the STM 32 and Free RTOS
  development boards
* developing hardware interfaces for sensors and actuators for the
  Open PCA Pump

The overall focus for this project is developing interfaces for
realistic sensors and actuators and getting the real-time aspects of
the PCA pump figured out.

Mine Water Pump Monitoring and Controlling
******************************************

This is a well-known example with the formal methods and real-time
systems community and is presented in detail in the book "Analyzeable
Real-Time Systems: Programmed in Ada" by Alan Burns and Andy Wellings.
In the book, models (but not in AADL) of the system are presented, and
implementations are given in Ada.

This project will adapt the mine control implementation from the Burns
and Wellings book by:

* Re-working the modeling of the example in AADL
* Adding real-time time annotations to AADL, following the detailed
  specifications in the Burns and Wellings book
* Developing mocked-up sensors and actuators for the example to be
  controlled through the STM32 board (sensors: CO2, Methane, water
  levels, water flows; actuators: water pump, etc.)
* Developing an operator interface for the example

  
Isolette 
********************************

This is an example used to illustrate proper engineering of
requirements in the FAA Requirements Engineering Management Handbook
that we have used previously in the course.

This is a slightly smaller example, and the work will come from
expanding it in several directions, including having one or more
communication interfaces associated with it.
