   <h3>CS 855: Development of High-Assurance Software Systems, Spring 2021</h3>

.. include:: def.rst

----

Purpose
********************

The course will cover techniques for developing high assurance systems -- systems that are safety critical, security critical, or mission critical in nature. In contrast to general purpose systems, high assurance system development tends to place a more stronger emphasis on rigorous requirements and specifications, verification and validation, risk management, and certification. High assurance system development is more likely to be amenable to and benefit from formal verification techniques -- techniques that use various forms of machine-checkable mathematics or logic to demonstrate that a system satisfies its specification. The goal of this course teach techniques for developing critical software that would usually not be covered in other courses in your computer science degree program. In particular, the course will focus on writing requirements for safety critical systems, formal architecture definition, risk management techniques including various forms of hazard analysis, safety systems, and automated verification. We will aim to illustrate an end-to-end development process for critical systems using examples of varying size.

Note: There is not enough time in the course to cover all topics
relevant to safety-critical system development in detail.
Topics chosen by the instructor in a particular semester will depend on the
instructor's current research activities.

Topics
*********

.. COMMENTS
   * Development process and life-cycle for safety-critical systems

   * Explain and apply a methodology for writing requirements for safety-critical systems
   * Know and apply risk management and hazard analysis techniques such as PHA, FTA, FMECA, STPA
   * Use tools for formal architecture and behavior specification relevant to critical systems
   * Understand concepts and context relevant to safety-critical systems such as traceability, designing for testing/verification, safety architectures, etc.
   * Be familiar with concepts related to system certification, regulation, and application of standards

* Understand and explain the utility of model-driven development for embedded systems
* Be able to use AADL to specify the software architecture of a simple real-time embedded system
* Be able to apply the HAMR framework to generate code infrastructure for a simple real-time embedded system
* Be able to use Slang to implement the application component logic for a simple real-time embedded system 

Meeting Times
*************

:Time: Tuedays (T) & Thursdays (U), 2:30pm - 3:45pm
:Place: |DUE0096|


Prerequisites
*************

The course does not have any official prequisites, but CS 721
Real-Time Systems would be helpful.

There is quite a bit of programming in the course, so strong
experience with programming and development environments will be helpful.

Office Hours: by appointment


Grading
*******

* Individual Homework Assignments (35%)
* Quizzes (15%)
* Team Projects (50%)

Final letter grades are assigned based on the following scale:
90% to earn an A, and 80% to earn a B; 70% to earn a C, and 60% to earn a D.

This course includes both individual assignments and team
projects. Individual assignments are expected to be completed
"individually" (with no collaboration with other students). For team
projects, each student is expected to make a unique and substantial
contribution to the assigned project. Expectations for the project
will be clarified by constructing a written contract that will
summarize scope of the project, expected artifacts along with format
and completeness of artifacts to be delivered, role and
responsibilities of individual team members. The department does not
assign a teaching assistant for this course. Because it will be
difficult for the instructor to cover all the grading responsibilities
for the course, the assessment mechanisms for the course will involve
students in the course critiquing and evaluating work of other
students (note that this type of activity will be overseen by the
instructor to ensure quality).


Attendance Policy
*****************

In general, there will be NO make-up exams (and homework)!
Special consideration will be given in only exceptional circumstances.
Exceptional circumstances are generally limited to:

* Emergencies: death in student's immediate family, or 
  near-death experience of the student.

* Non-emergencies: certified excused absences for official university activities.

If you believe you qualify for exceptional treatment, you must notify the
instructor prior to the date of the exam or exercise to be missed.


Statement Regarding Academic Honesty
************************************

Kansas State University has an Honor System based on personal integrity, which 
is presumed to be sufficient assurance in academic matters one's work is
performed honestly and without unauthorized assistance. 
Undergraduate and graduate students, by registration, acknowledge the
jurisdiction of the Honor System.
The policies and procedures of the Honor System apply to all full and part-time
students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate courses on-campus, off-campus,
and via distance learning.
The honor system website can be reach via the following URL: 
http://www.ksu.edu/honor.

A component vital to the Honor System is the inclusion of the Honor Pledge which
applies to all assignments, examinations, or other course work undertaken by
students.
The Honor Pledge is implied, whether or not it is stated:
"On my honor, as a student, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid
on this academic work."
A grade of XF can result from a breach of academic honesty.
The F indicates failure in the course; the X indicates the reason is an Honor
Pledge violation.


Other Administrative Issues
***************************

* **Incompletenes:** An incomplete (I) final grade will be given only by prior
  arrangement in exceptional circumstances conforming to departmental policy in
  which the bulk of course work has been completed in passing fashion.

* **Drop Policy:** It is your responsibility to drop the course if you are
  enrolled but decide not to complete the course --- there are no "automatic"
  drops due to nonattendance.
  The University allows a retake of a course with removal of the prior grade,
  at most once per course, for a maximum of five courses.
  
* **Students with Disabilities:** If you have any physical or learning
  disability which will make it difficult for you to carry out the work as
  I have outlined in this syllabus or which will require academic
  accommodations, please notify me the first two weeks of the course.

* **Harrassment:** One purpose of your education is to help you develop skills,
  approaches, and abilities that are necessary for effective teamwork, and for
  your success in your profession and as a citizen.
  It is important that you understand your rights and responsibilities regarding
  the University's Sexual and Racial Harassment policies (full text of the
  policies can be found on KSU's web site at
  http://www.ksu.edu/uauc/fhbook/fhxj.html).
  If you experience any situations, in or out of class, that seem inappropriate
  or that make you uncomfortable, a list of resources and courses of action to
  assist you can be found on the College of Engineering web site at
  http://www.engg.ksu.edu/harassment-statement.

* **Expectations for Classroom Conduct:** All student activities in the
  University, including this course, are governed by the Student Judicial
  Conduct Code as outlined in the Student Government Association By Laws,
  Article VI, Section 3, number 2.
  Students that engage in behavior that disrupts the learning environment may be
  asked to leave the class.

* **Campus Safety:** Kansas State University is committed to providing a safe
  teaching and learning environment for student and faculty members.
  In order to enhance your safety in the unlikely case of a campus emergency
  make sure that you know where and how to quickly exit your classroom and how
  to follow any emergency directives.
  To view additional campus emergency information go to the University's main
  page, http://www.k-state.edu, and click on the Emergency Information button.

* **Copyright Issues:** Class and lecture notes for this course carry a
  copyright.
  Students are prohibited from selling (or being paid for taking) notes during
  this course to or by any person or commercial firm without the express written
  permission of the professor teaching this course.
