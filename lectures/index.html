<p><strong>Tool Tutorial: HAMR Installation</strong></p>
<p>This video covers installation of the HAMR tool following the options of a direct install (as opposed to the virtual machine option) and using the Formal Methods Integrated Development Environment (FMIDE) customization of the OSATE AADL editor (as opposed to installing HAMR in the “regular” OSATE distribution). Instructions for other types of installation can be found on the HAMR website. Also, this video addresses installation of the tools needed for Slang development of HAMR-generated components. The HAMR website explains how to extend this installation with the tools needed for C development of HAMR-generated components.</p>

<p><strong>Tool Tutorial: Loading an Generated/Existing HAMR Slang Project into the IntelliJ-based Sireum IVE</strong></p>
<p>Given an AADL model, HAMR can generate a HAMR Slang project with AADL run-time infrastructure and component code skeletons that you add application code to to get a complete system. This video explains how you open a HAMR Slang project in the Sireum IVE (a customization of IntelliJ). These instructions also apply to opening existing HAMR Slang projects that are distributed in the HAMR Slang tutorials. The tutorial addresses the basic structure of HAMR Slang projects, notes the use of the Scala Build Tool (SBT) to manage project builds, describes basic correspondences between HAMR generated Slang code and AADL models, describes how to compile and run a HAMR Slang project, how to run unit tests. The tutorial concludes with an initial discussion of project files that should be not checked into git and other source code repositories.</p>

<p><strong>Tool Exercise: Refactoring an AADL Model to Remove Ports and Change Port Categories</strong></p>
<p>This is an exercise designed for you to complete on your own following the provided instructions. A solution video is provided that is meant to be used help you resolve any difficulties encountered when trying to do the exercise on your own.</p>
<p>In this exercise, you will carry out a simple refactoring of some of the component ports in the Temperature Control example. You will start from the AADL model in the HAMR-Slang-Tutorials-Example-00.zip that you imported into OSATE in the tutorials above. This refactoring will involve changing the kinds of ports and connections used to communicate temperature information from the sensor to the controller (and to the operator interface). This will require changing the AADL thread component types for TempSensor , TempController , and OperatorInterface components, as well as making some simple changes to corresponding AADL flow specifications. By performing this refactoring, you will gain an initial understanding of (a) AADL architecture models (basic ideas of ports and connections) and (b) using the OSATE editor to make simple edits in the AADL graphical and textual views.</p>

<p><strong>Tool Exercise: Refactoring a Slang Implementation of an AADL System</strong></p>
<p>This is an exercise designed for you to complete on your own following the provided instructions. A solution video is provided that is meant to be used help you resolve any difficulties encountered when trying to do the exercise on your own.</p>
<p>This exercise is designed to help you learn the basics of using HAMR to generate Slang implementations of AADL-based systems, Slang thread component application logic, and Slang port-communication APIs.</p>
<p>In this exercise, you will carry out a simple refactoring of some of the Slang application code in the Temperature Control example. This builds on a refactoring of the original Temperature Control AADL model carried out in a previous exercise. In that exercise you changed the kinds of ports and connections used to communicate temperature information from the sensor to the controller (and to the operator interface). In this exercise, you will regenerate the Slang code from the refactored AADL model. This will keep most of the existing code, but it will change the Slang APIs associated with your component ports to align with the refactored models. This will leave the Slang code with some syntax errors because the old application code will not completely match the newly regenerated APIs for port communication. To address this, you will then need to make some small changes in the Slang component application code to match the new version of the generated port APIs. You will confirm that your refactored code is working correctly by compiling and running it with the Proyek build system in IntelliJ.</p>
<p>This exercise is meant to start from the state of your AADL models and Slang code from previous exercises. However, if you don’t have your files in a proper state, the .zip file below contains both AADL models and Slang code in the correct state for starting the exercise. You will need to import these files into OSATE and Sireum IVE (see the exercise description).</p>

<p>In the previous exercise “Creating an AADL Model from Scratch”, you created an AADL model of a simple producer/consumer system. In this exercise, you will build a Slang-based implementation of the system that will run on the JVM. This will help you learn how to prepare your directory structure for HAMR Slang code generation, invoke the HAMR code generator to generate Slang code from an AADL model, code simple application logic (for the Producer and Consumer threads, in this example), and compile and run the system.</p>
<p>This exercise is meant to start from the state of your AADL models in the previous “Creating an AADL Model from Scratch” exercise. However, if you don’t have your files in a proper state, the HAMR-Slang-Tutorials-Prod-Cons-AADL-only.zip file below contains AADL Producer/Consumer model (essentially the model-solution for the previous exercise). These are in the correct state for starting the exercise. You will need to import these files into OSATE following the steps that you took in the exercise “Loading an Existing AADL Project into OSATE/FMIDE”.</p>

<h2 id="disaster-cast-podcast">Disaster Cast Podcast</h2>
<p>The Disaster Cast podcast by safety engineer Drew Rae is an execellent source for interesting stories and intuitive explanations of safety-related concepts.   Unfortunately, the podcast is a bit old now, and the original website seems to be unavailable.   However, the files have been snarfed up by several podcast websites.  For example, you can find the recordings at this <a href="https://podbay.fm/p/disastercast-safety-podcast">link</a>.</p>
<p>The links below organize a selection of the podcasts into phases; I have selected some that I found especially interesting or that convey important concepts that I think should be emphasized in this course.  The overviews of for each phase linked below include instructions for how I would like you to listen to and take some simple notes on the podcast episodes.</p>
